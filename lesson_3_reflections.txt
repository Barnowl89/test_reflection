When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  This is particularly useful for collaboration, as well as working from multiple locations
  
  
  
Lesson 3 notes:
    Setup Github account (instructions online)
    Create repository. Check create README option if a repository does not already exist

	git remote
		lists actve remotes

	git remote add <name> <URL>
		default remote name is 'origin', use this.
		copy URL from Github eg https://github.com/Barnowl89/test_reflection.git
		Make sure to use HTTPS not SSH

	git remote -v
		(verbose) shows URLs for fetch and push (usually the same)

	git push <remote_name> <branch_name>
		eg git puch origin master
		pushes the chosen branch to Github servers
