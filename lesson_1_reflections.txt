How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

	Enables checking of each line were a modification has been made individually, rather than the entire body of code

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

	Avoids the need for duplication where a mistake cannot be identified. Avoid re-writing code

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	pro: changes saved can reflect logical changes to the code, rather than changes based on time etc which may result in un-compilable code
	con: user discretion is required, and failing to commit can result in loss of work or duplication

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

	Allows for experimentation because there will always be a version to fall back to

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	SQL/Python development projects
